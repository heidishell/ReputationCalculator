# 1. Bloodsail Buccaneers Calculator
# This calculates the number of Booty Bay bruisers you'll have to grind in order to get to Honored with Bloodsail Buccaneers.
# Designed with "Insane in the Membrane" achievement in mind.
# Output is a rough estimate since you might end up grinding other NPCs in order to get bruisers to spawn.
# However, the other NPCs are only 5 rep each so I just counted the main source of rep -- the bruisers which give 25 rep each.
